# How to Use create-react-app With Typescript

Run this command in your terminal

```sh
npx create-react-app --template typescript .
```

Here we’ve used npx to run create-react-app without installing it. We specified an
option --template typescript, so our app will have all the settings needed to work
with Typescript.

## Project Structure Generated By Create-React-App

Let’s look at the application structure.

If you’ve used create-react-app before - it will look familiar.

```
├── public
│ ├── favicon.ico
│ ├── index.html
│ ├── logo192.png
│ ├── logo512.png
│ ├── manifest.json
│ └── robots.txt
├── src
│ ├── App.css
│ ├── App.test.tsx
│ ├── App.tsx
│ ├── index.css
│ ├── index.tsx
│ ├── logo.svg
│ ├── react-app-env.d.ts
│ ├── reportWebVitals.ts
│ └── setupTests.ts
├── node_modules
│ └── ...
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── package-lock.json
```

Let’s go through the files and see why do we need them there. We’ll make a short
overview, and then we’ll get back to some of the files and talk about them a bit more.

## Files in the root

### README.md

This is a markdown file that contains a description of your application.
For example, Github will use this file to generate an html summary that you can see
at the bottom of projects.

### package.json

This file contains metadata relevant to the project. For example,
it contains the name, version and description of our app. It also contains the
dependencies list with external libraries that our app depends on.

You can find the full list of possible package.json fields and their descriptions
on [npm website](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Now let’s open package.json file and check what are the packages that are installed
with create-react-app:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.3",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.4",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "@types/jest": "^27.4.1",
    "@types/node": "^16.11.26",
    "@types/react": "^17.0.43",
    "@types/react-dom": "^17.0.14",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.0",
    "typescript": "^4.6.3",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  },
```

Now, most packages that we use have a corresponding @types/\* package.

| 📝  | I’m showing only the dependencies block because this is where type definitions are installed. You won’t find any types-packages in devDependencies. |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Those `@types/*` packages contain type definitions for libraries originally written in
Javascript. Why do we need them if Typescript can parse the Javascript code as well?
Problem with Javascript is that a lot of times it’s impossible to tell what types will
the code work with.

### package-lock.json

This file is generated when you install the dependencies by running npm
in your project root. This file contains resolved dependencies versions along with
their sub-dependencies. It is needed to have consistent installs on different machines.
If you use npm to manage dependencies - you will have a package-lock.json instead.

### tsconfig.json

It contains the Typescript configuration. We don’t need to edit this
file because the default settings work fine for us.

### .gitignore

This file contains the list of files and folders that shouldn’t end up in your
git repository.

These are all the files that we can find in the root of our project. Now let’s take a
look at the folders.

## public Folder

The public folder contains the static files for our app. They are not included in the
compilation process and remain untouched during the build.

### index.html

This file contains a special <div id="root"> that will be a mounting
point for our React application.

### manifest.json

It provides application metadata for Progressive Web Apps³¹. For
example, this file allows installing your application on a mobile phone’s home screen,
similar to native apps. It contains the app name, icons, theme colors, and other data
needed to make your app installable.

### favicon.ico, logo192.png, logo512.png

These are icons for your application. There
is favicon.ico, it’s a favicon, a small icon that is shown on browser tabs. Also,
there are two bigger icons: logo192.png and logo512.png. They are referenced in
manifest.json and will be used on mobile devices if your app will be added to the
home screen.

### robots.txt

It tells crawlers what resources they shouldn’t access. By default it allows
everything.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## src Folder

Now let’s take a look at the src folder. Files in this folder will be processed by webpack
and will be added to your app’s bundle.

This folder contains a bunch of files with .tsx extension: index.tsx, App.tsx,
App.test.tsx. It means that those files contain JSX code.

| 📝  | JSX is an html-like syntax used in React applications to describe the layout. Read more about it in [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

In Javascript React application - we could use either .jsx or .js extensions for such
files. It would make no difference.

With Typescript - you should use `.tsx` extensions on files that have JSX code, and
`.ts` on files that don’t.

It is important because otherwise there can be a syntactic clash. Both Typescript and
JSX use angle brackets, but for different purposes.

### index.tsx

Most important file in /src folder is index.tsx. It is an entry point for our application.
It means that webpack will start to build our application from this file, and then will
recursively include other files referenced by import statements.

### App.tsx

Let’s open src/App.tsx. If you use modern create-react-app this file won’t have
any difference from the regular Javascript version.

### react-app-env.d.ts

Another file with an interesting extension is react-app-env.d.ts, let’s take a look.
Files with `*.d.ts` extensions contain Typescript types definitions.

Usually, it’s needed
for libraries that were originally written in Javascript.
